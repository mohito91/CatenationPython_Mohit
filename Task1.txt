#Task 1

#1. Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of
#them belongs to a different data type.

a,b,c = 'x',1,4.6
print(a,b,c)

#2. Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.
a = 2 + 3j
b = 3
print ("a: ",a)
print ("b: ",b)
c=a
a=b
b=c
print("swapped value of a: ")
print("swapped value of b: ")

#3. Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.
#with third variable
a = int(input("Please enter value of a: "))
b = int(input("Please enter value of b: "))
c = a
a = b
b = c
print ("swapped value of a is: ",a)
print ("swapped value of b is: ",b)

#without third variable
a = int(input("Please enter value of a: "))
b = int(input("Please enter value of b: "))
a,b = b,a
print ("swapped value of a is: ",a)
print ("swapped value of b is: ",b)


# 4. Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x
# Version.

a= eval(input("please enter a number:"))
print("The number you entered is:",a)

# 5
# Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in
# another variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the
# final output.

def sum (x,y):
    res = x + y
    return res
a = int(input("please enter your first number between 1 and 10: "))
b = int(input("please enter your second number between 1 and 10: "))
z = sum(a,b)
result = sum(30,z)
print(result)

#6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
# HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc
a = eval(input("enter any value to show the data type: "))
print(type(a))

# 7. Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and
# UPPERCASE.
# (Refer: https://capitalizemytitle.com/camel-case/)

a = 'ThisIsUpperCamel'
b = 'thisIsLowerCamel'
c = 'THISISUPPERCASE'
d = 'this_is_snake_case'
print(a,b,c,d)

#converting Upper Camel to Snake
def changetosnake(a):
    res = [a[0].lower()]
    for i in a[1:]:
        if i in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'):
            res.append('_')
            res.append(i.lower())
        else:
            res.append(i)
    return ''.join(res)

a = "MyNameIsMohit"
print(changetosnake(a))



# 8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
# again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

#yes, the value of a will change. since, Python is dynamic and imperative.
